# Status Screen

This is the main repository for a status screen project. This repository contains all of the documentation for both the screen itself, and the protocol by which it shall be driven.

## Concept

A computer will drive a screen connected to a microcontroller over a serial connection. This screen can do things like show the status of a computer (things like CPU Usage, RAM Usage, etc.), or do fun things like draw images directly from the computer onto the screen. My goal is to not limit your imagination by implementing a well-engineered standard that is not stupid.
